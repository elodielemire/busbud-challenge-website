## Heroku link

You can find the app here : https://mysterious-river-33333.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Modules required : **moments** and **boostrap**
It was initialy made with **node-sass-chokidar** but it was not compatible for the deployement on Heroku. (That's why there is an App.scss)

## Future improvements

- Separate the actions functions from the App.js file
- Use reducers
- Handle errors
- Allow the user to sort the result by price - Done in [pull request #5](https://github.com/elodielemire/busbud-challenge-website/pull/5)
